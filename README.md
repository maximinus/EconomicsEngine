# Economics Engine


## Overview

The goal of the project is to produce a library to simulate a model economy for a game or for simple experimentation.

There are some assumptions made about how an economy works; the basics are built around a free market system with companies and competition, into which we add financial systems, workers, a government and money.

It is not the intention of the author to adhere to a particular economic or political creed; the intention is to simulate an economy.
